          The Smile guys, Inc. d/b/a bizflip.io (“bizflip,” “we”, “us”, or
          “our”) is committed to protecting your privacy. We have prepared this
          Privacy Policy to describe to you our practices regarding the Personal
          Data (as defined below) we collect, use, and share in connection with
          the bizflip.io website, mobile app, and other software provided on or
          in connection with our services, as described in our Terms of Service
          (collectively, the “Service”). “NFT” in this Privacy Policy means a
          non-fungible token or similar digital item implemented on a blockchain
          (such as the Ethereum blockchain), which uses smart contracts to link
          to or otherwise be associated with certain content or data.

            Types of Data We Collect. “Personal Data” means data that allows
            someone to identify you individually, including, for example, your
            name, email address, as well as any other non-public information
            about you that is associated with or linked to any of the foregoing.
            “Anonymous Data” means data, including aggregated and de-identified
            data, that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Data;
            Anonymous Data does not, by itself, permit the identification of
            individual persons. We collect Personal Data and Anonymous Data as
            described below.
          </li>
          <li>Information You Provide Us.</li>
          <li>
            When you use our Service, update your account profile, or contact
            us, we may collect Personal Data from you, such as email address,
            first and last name, user name, and other information you provide.
            We also collect your blockchain address, which may become associated
            with Personal Data when you use our Service.

          </li>
          <li>
            If you provide us with feedback or contact us, we will collect your
            name and contact information, as well as any other content included
            in the message.
          </li>
          <li>
            We may also collect Personal Data at other points in our Service
            where you voluntarily provide it or where we state that Personal
            Data is being collected.

          <li>
            Information Collected via Technology. As you navigate through and
            interact with our Service, we may use automatic data collection
            technologies to collect certain information about your equipment,

          </li>
          <li>
            Information Collected by Our Servers. To provide our Service and
            make it more useful to you, we (or a third party service provider)
            collect information from you, including, but not limited to, your
            browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address,
            mobile device ID, blockchain address, wallet type, and date/time
            stamps.
          </li>
          <li>
            Log Files. As is true of most websites and applications, we gather
            certain information automatically and store it in log files. This
            information includes IP addresses, browser type, Internet service
            provider (“ISP”), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time
            stamps, and clickstream data. We use this information to analyze
            trends, administer the Service, track users’ movements around the
            Service, and better tailor our Services to our users’ needs. For
            example, some of the information may be collected so that when you
            visit the Service, it will recognize you and the information can be
            used to personalize your experience.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cookies. Like many online services, we use cookies to collect
            information. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you
            close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your
            computer until you delete them) to analyze how users interact with
            our Service, make improvements to our product quality, and provide
            users with a more personalized experience.

            Pixel Tag. In addition, we use “Pixel Tags” (also referred to as
            clear Gifs, Web beacons, or Web bugs). Pixel Tags allow us to
            analyze how users find our Service, make the Service more useful to
            you, and tailor your experience with us to meet your particular
            interests and needs.

            How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals. Our systems do not currently
            recognize “do not track” signals or other mechanisms that might
            enable Users to opt out of tracking on our site.
          </li>
          <li>
            Analytics Services. In addition to the tracking technologies we
            place like Cookies and Pixel Tags, other companies may set their own
            cookies or similar tools when you visit our Service. This includes
            third-party analytics services (“Analytics Services”) that we engage
            to help analyze how users use the Service. The information generated
            by the Cookies or other technologies about your use of our Service
            (the “Analytics Information”) is transmitted to the Analytics
            Services. The Analytics Services use Analytics Information to
            compile reports on user activity, which we may receive on an
            individual or aggregate basis. We use the information we get from
            Analytics Services to improve our Service. The Analytics Services
            may also transfer information to third parties where required to do
            so by law, or where such third parties process Analytics Information
            on their behalf. Each Analytics Services’ ability to use and share
            Analytics Information is restricted by such Analytics Services’
            terms of use and privacy policy. By using our Service, you consent
            to the processing of data about you by Analytics Services in the
            manner and for the purposes set out above.

            have already collected from or about you through our Service.

        <h3>1. How we collect personal information.</h3>
        <p>
          In the course of providing Services to you, we collect or receive your
          personal information directly from you, for example, during
          registration; indirectly from you based on your activity and
          interaction with our Services, or from the device or browser you use
          to access the Services; from our vendors and suppliers that help
          provide services you may interact with and from our third party
          advertising and marketing partners. Often, you choose what information
          to provide, but sometimes we require certain information to provide
          you the with Services. Bizflip uses the personal information it
          receives and collects in accordance with the purposes described in
          this policy. <br></br>To use our Services, you will need to enter a
          valid email address/wallet. If you register, you will need to submit a

          account settings. You need to provide this information to enable us to
          provide you with the Services. Additional information, such as billing
          and payment information (including billing contact name, address,
          telephone number, credit card information), a telephone number, and/or
          a physical postal address, may be necessary in order for us to provide
          a particular service. As an Bizflip seller, if you choose to use our
          payment service (“Bizflip Payments“), Bizflip requires your full name,
          identification ID or tax ID, date of birth, bank account information,
          photograph, credit card information, and/or other proof of
          identification in order to verify your identity, provide this service
          to you, and comply with applicable law. For both buyers and sellers,
          Bizflip requires this information from you in order to provide you
          with the Services (including, to verify ownership of an account, to
          mitigate fraud and abuse, to comply with regulatory obligations, or to
          facilitate transactions between buyers and sellers). We may store
          credit card information for both billing and payment purposes. If you
          are an Bizflip buyer, you may be asked to pre-authenticate your
          payment method prior to placing a bid. <br></br>You may provide your
          other personal information (such as birthday, gender, location) in
          connection with your account and activity. You can edit or remove this

          registered users may see the date you joined; ratings, reviews and
          information relating to assets you have sold or bought or comments
          left by you on listings. <br></br>For sellers, we may collect and use
          information about you in order to feature you in marketing and
          advertising materials and campaigns, and to feature your listings, as
          provided for in our Terms of Service.<br></br> Bizflip automatically
          and records information from your browser or your mobile device when
          you visit the Website, or use certain features of the Services, such
          as your IP address/wallet or unique device identifier, cookies, and
          data about which pages you visit and how you interact with those pages
          in order to allow us to operate and provide the Services. This
          information is stored in log files and is collected automatically. We
          may combine this information from your browser or your mobile device
          with other information that we or our advertising or marketing
          partners collect about you, including across devices. This information
          is used to prevent fraud and to keep the Services secure, to analyse
          and understand how the Services work for registered users and
          visitors, and to provide advertising, including across your devices,
          and a more personalised experience for registered users and visitors.
          Bizflip receives information from our advertising and marketing
          partners about you. This information can include attribution
          information via cookies and UTM tags in URLs to determine where a
          visit to Bizflip comes from, responses to marketing emails and
          advertisements, responses to offers, and audience information from
          partners who you have given consent to share that information with us.
          We collect information about your use of the Services for advertising,
          for analytics, to serve content, and to protect the Services. This can
          include your IP address and browser information (including referrers).
          You can choose to publish your location when you sell on Bizflip. We
          obtain location information you provide in your profile or your IP
          address. Certain non-precise location services, such as for security
          and localised policies based on your IP address or submitted address,
          are critical for the Website to function. We will only share your
          geolocation details with third parties in order to provide you with
          the Services.<br></br> Some users may choose to connect to Bizflip or
          register an Bizflip account using an external third-party application,
          Google. Connecting your Bizflip account to third-party applications or
          services is optional. If you choose to connect your account to a
          third-party application, Bizflip can receive information from that
          application. We may use that information as part of providing the
          Services to you. Certain third-party applications that you use to
          create or sign in to your account may provide you with the option to
          discontinue receiving messages from us or allows you to forward those
          messages to another email address. If we are unable to send you
          critical messages about your account, we may suspend or terminate your
          account. Bizflip receives or obtains information (for example, an
          email address or IP address) about a person who is not yet a
          registered Bizflip user (a “non-registered-user”) in connection with
          certain Bizflip features, such as when a non-registered user chooses
          to subscribe to a Bizflip newsletter or a registered user invites a
          non-registered user to visit the Website. Non-registered user
          information is used only for the purposes disclosed when it was
          submitted to Bizflip, for purposes necessary to the functioning of
          Bizflip’s Services or where bizflip has a legitimate interest, or to
          facilitate action authorized by a user.

        <h3>2. Communication from Bizflip.</h3>
        <p>
          On occasion, Bizflip will need to contact you. Primarily, these
          messages are delivered by email or the discussion forum for a variety
          of reasons, including marketing, transactions, and service update
          purposes. You can opt out of receiving marketing communications via
          email or by following the unsubscribe link in any marketing email you
          receive.<br></br>
          To ensure you properly receive notifications, we will need to collect
          certain information about your device, such as operating system and
          user identification information. Every account is required to keep a
          valid email address on file to receive messages. Bizflip may also
          contact you by telephone to provide support or for transaction-related
          purposes if you request that we call you. Additionally, and with your
          consent where required by applicable law, Bizflip may send you an SMS
          (or similar) message, or reach out to you by telephone, in order to
          provide you with customer support, for research or feedback, or to
          provide you with information about listings and features that you may
          find of interest. You can update your contact preferences in your
          account settings. <br></br>
          Some messages from Bizflip are service-related and necessary for all
          users. You understand and agree that Bizflip can send you
          non-marketing emails, messages via the discussion forum, or messages,
          such as those related to transactions, your account, security, or
          listing changes. Examples of service-related messages include an email
          address confirmation/welcome email when you register your account,
          notification of a bid or offer, service availability, modification of
          key features or functions, relaying messages with buyers, and
          correspondence with our customer support team. When you register for
          an account, subscribe to a newsletter, or provide us with your email
          address or phone number, you receive notice of and agree (in some
          jurisdictions and situations, by an additional unambiguous consent) to
          receive marketing emails and messages from us. You can unsubscribe at
          any time from marketing emails or messages through the opt-out link
          included in marketing emails or messages. Registered users and
          subscribers can also control which marketing emails or messages they
          receive from Bizflip through their account settings. Please note that
          some changes to your account settings may take a few days to take
          effect.
        </p>
        <h3>3. Communicating with other users and commenting </h3>
        <p>
          Bizflip is a marketplace and a community. We offer several features
          that allow registered users to connect, communicate, and comment.
          Please use common sense and good judgment if you choose to post,
          comment, communicate or share your personal information with others
          through the Services. Be aware that any personal information that you
          choose to submit there can be read, collected, or used by others, or
          could be used to send unsolicited messages to you. You are responsible
          for the personal information that you choose to post using the
          Services.

            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Our legitimate interests <br></br>
            We principally rely on consent (which can be withdrawn at anytime)
            (i) to send marketing messages, (ii) for third-party data sharing
            related to advertising, and, to the extent applicable, (iii) for the
            use of location data for advertising purposes. We rely on consent
            for targeted online and offline marketing including through tools
            like Facebook Audience Match and Google Customer Match. We or our
            sellers may advertise our Services or our sellers’ listings through
            a variety of different mediums and rely on your consent to do so
            off-site. As part of this, we may work with advertising partners
            such as Facebook, Google, and other partners disclosed in our
            Cookies & Tracking Policies. These partners have their own privacy
            policies and consent mechanisms for their customers, in addition to
            bizflip’s controls. You may see the privacy policies and privacy
            choices for these partners, and the information you share with them,
            in our Cookies & tracking Policies. <br></br>
            Where we process your information on the basis of legitimate
            interests, we do so as follows:
          </p>
          <h3>To provide and improve our Services</h3>
          <p>
            We use your information for the legitimate purpose of improving and
            customising our Services for users, including sharing your
            information for such purposes. This is also necessary to enable us
            to pursue our legitimate interests in understanding how our Services
            are being used, and to explore ways to develop and grow our
            business. It is also necessary to allow us to pursue our legitimate
            interests in improving our Services, efficiency and gaining insights
            into usage patterns of our Services. We have a legitimate interest
            in customizing your on-site experience to help you search for and
            discover relevant assets and recommended assets, including using
            this information to help sellers find the best ways to market and
            sell their assets on Bizflip.
          </p>
          <h3>For advertising and marketing</h3>
          <p>
            We rely on our legitimate interest to send you marketing messages
            (where permitted independent of consent) and for Bizflip’s
            advertising programmes (including Bizflip’s on-site advertising and
            marketing).
          </p>
          <h3>For safety and security of Services</h3>
          <p>
            We use your information for safety and security purposes, which can
            include sharing your information for such purposes, and we do so
            because it is necessary to pursue our legitimate interests or those
            of a third party in ensuring the security of our Services,
            preventing harm to individuals or property, or crime, enforcing or
            defending legal rights, or preventing damage to Bizflip’s systems,
            or those of our users or our partners. This includes enhancing
            protection of our community against spam, harassment, intellectual
            property infringement, crime, and security risks of all kinds. We
            use your information to provide and improve the Services, for
            billing and payments, for identification and authentication, and for
            general research and aggregate reporting. For example, we may use
            information you provide to resolve disputes with Bizflip or other
            users.
          </p>
          <h3>To facilitate the sales process</h3>
          <p>
            As part of the buying and selling process, Bizflip will facilitate
            the sharing of information between the two users involved in the
            transaction. This can also involve us sharing your information with
            some of our third-party partners to enable us to provide the
            Services to you. Such partners will process your personal
            information in accordance with their own privacy policies. In some
            instances, while they are subject to Bizflip’s privacy and security
            requirements, these partners, not Bizflip, are responsible for the
            protection of personal information under their control. By making a
            sale or a purchase on Bizflip, you are directing us to share your
            information in this way. Since this is an important part of the
            Services we provide, we need to do this in order to perform our
            obligations under our Terms of service, We expect you to respect the
            privacy of the user whose information you have received. As
            described in our Terms of Service, you have a limited license to use
            that information only for Bizflip-related communications or for
            Bizflip-facilitated transactions. Bizflip has not granted a license
            to you to use the information for unauthorized transactions or
            sending unsolicited commercial messages in violation of any
            applicable laws, including any consent requirements of the
            jurisdiction of the recipient.
          </p>
          <h3>To customize your Bizflip experience</h3>
          <p>
            We may learn about the types of assets that you’re interested in
            from your browsing and purchasing behaviour on (and off) the Website
            and use such information to suggest potential purchases as a result.
            As a core part of our Services, we have a legitimate interest in
            customising your on-site experience to help you search for and
            discover relevant items and recommended purchases, including using
            this information to help sellers find the best ways to market and
            sell their listings on Bizflip.
          </p>
          <h3>For legal and security reasons</h3>
          <p>
            Bizflip may also retain, preserve, or release your personal
            information to a third party in the following limited circumstances:
            in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to
            meet legitimate national security or law enforcement requirements;
            to protect, establish, or exercise our legal rights or defend
            against impending or asserted legal claims, including to collect a
            debt, or a material violation of our policies; to comply with a
            subpoena, court order, legal process, regulation, or other legal
            requirement; or when we believe in good faith that such disclosure
            is reasonably necessary to comply with the law, prevent imminent
            physical harm or financial loss, or investigate, prevent, or take
            action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, threats to our
            rights or property, or violations of our Terms of Service.<br></br>
            If Bizflip receives a lawful, verified request for a user’s records
            or information in one of the limited circumstances described in the
            previous paragraph, Bizflip may disclose personal information, which
            may include, but may not be limited to, a users’ name, address,
            phone number, email address, company/trading name and, where
            appropriate, bank account and transaction details.
          </p>
          <h3>For our affiliates </h3>
          <p>
            Bizflip is affiliated with a variety of businesses and works closely
            with them for a variety of purposes, including assisting us to
            perform and improve the Services. These businesses may sell items or
            services to you through the Website or Services or, with your
            consent, offer promotions (including email promotions) to you. When
            an affiliated business assists in facilitating your transaction, we
            may need to share information related to the transaction with that
            affiliated business in order to facilitate your transaction, and
            this forms part of the Services we provide in accordance with our
            Terms of Service. We rely on consent (which can be withdrawn at any
            time) to send marketing messages and for third-party sharing
            relating to advertising. As part of this, we may work with
            advertising partners such as Facebook or Google and we may use
            analytics aggregated from usage information including, for example,
            search keywords, favourites, browsing history and purchase history.
          </p>
          <h3>For our service providers</h3>
          <p>
            Bizflip also needs to engage third-party companies and individuals
            (such as research companies, and analytics and security providers)
            to help us operate, provide, and market the Services. These third
            parties have only limited access to your information, may use your
            information only to perform these tasks on our behalf, and are
            obligated to bizflip not to disclose or use your information for
            other purposes. Our engagement of service providers is often
            necessary for us to provide the Services to you, particularly where
            such companies play important roles like helping us keep our Service
            operating and secure. In some other cases, these service providers
            aren’t strictly necessary for us to provide the Services, but help
            us make it better, like by helping us conduct research into how we
            could better serve our users. In these latter cases, we have a
            legitimate interest in working with service providers to make our
            Services better.
          </p>
          <h3>In the event of a restructure</h3>
          <p>
            In some cases, Bizflip may choose to buy or sell assets. Such
            transactions may be necessary and in our legitimate interests,
            particularly our interest in making decisions that enable our
            business to develop over the long term. In these types of
            transactions (such as a sale, merger, liquidation, receivership, or
            transfer of all or substantially all of Bizflip’s assets), user
            information is typically one of the business assets that is
            transferred. If Bizflip intends to transfer information about you,
            Bizflip will notify you by email or by putting a prominent notice on
            the Website, and you will be afforded an opportunity to opt out
            before information about you becomes subject to a different privacy
            policy.
          </p>
          <h3>Third parties</h3>
          <p>
            Third-party plug-ins also collect information about your use of the
            Website. For example, when you load a page on Bizflip that has a
            social plug-in from a third-party site or service, such as a “Like”
            or “Send” button, you are also loading content from that third-party
            site. That site may request cookies directly from your browser.
            These interactions are subject to the privacy policy of the
            third-party site. In addition, certain cookies and other similar
            technologies on the Website are used by third parties for targeted
            online marketing and other purposes.<br></br>
            These technologies allow a partner to recognise your computer or
            mobile device each time you use the Services. Please be aware that
            when you use third-party sites or services, their own terms and
            privacy policies will govern your use of those sites or services.
            Bizflip chooses and manages these third-party technologies placed on
            its Website. However, these are third-party technologies, and they
            are subject to that third party’s privacy policy. For more
            information, see our Cookies & Tracking policies. We rely on your
            consent to drop and read these cookies when not technically
            necessary or when not required based on another purpose such as
            legitimate interest. This policy does not apply to the practices of
            third parties (such as other users who sell assets using the
            Services, certain third-party providers on whom we rely to provide
            certain services, or API users) that Bizflip does not own or control
            or individuals that Bizflip does not employ or manage, except as
            otherwise provided for in the Terms of Service or as required by
            law. If you provide your information to such third parties in
            connection with your use of the Services, different practices may
            apply to the use or disclosure of the information that you provide
            to them. While Bizflip requires these third parties to follow
            Bizflip’s privacy and security requirements, Bizflip does not
            control the privacy or security policies of such third parties. To
            the full extent applicable in your jurisdiction, Bizflip is not
            responsible for the privacy or security practices of these sellers,
            API users, or other websites on the internet, even those linked to
            or from the Services. We encourage you to read the privacy policies
            and ask questions of third parties before you disclose your personal
            information to them. For the purposes of European law, these
            sellers, third party providers, and API users are independent
            controllers of data, which means that they are responsible for
            providing and complying with their own policies relating to any
            personal information they obtain in connection with the Services.

        <h3>5. How we transfer personal information </h3>
        <p>
          The United States and other countries all have different laws. When
          your information is moved from your home country to another country,
          the laws and rules that protect your personal information in the
          country to which your information is transferred may be different from
          those in the country in which you live. For example, the circumstances
          in which law enforcement can access personal information may vary from
          country to country. To the extent that Bizflip is deemed to transfer
          personal information outside of the EEA, this is necessary to allow us
          to deliver our Services to you as we provide a global service. As we
          operate in countries worldwide and use technical infrastructure in
          Australia, we need to transfer your personal information to Australia
          to other jurisdictions as necessary to provide the Services. The
          European Commission has adopted standard contractual clauses (also
          known as Model Clauses), which provide safeguards for personal
          information that is transferred outside of Europe. We often use these
          Model Clauses when transferring personal information outside of
          Europe. bizflip may or may not participate in Privacy Shield at this
          time.
        </p>
        <h3>6. Security of personal information</h3>
        <p>
          We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the
          personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and
          after it is received, for example encryption is used for certain
          information (such as credit card numbers) using TLS (transport layer
          security). Unfortunately, no method of transmission over the internet
          or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, while we
          strive to protect your personal information, we can’t guarantee its
          absolute security. Your account information is protected by a
          password. It is important that you protect against unauthorised access
          to your account and information by choosing your password carefully
          and by keeping your password and computer secure, such as by signing
          out after using the Services. If you have any questions about the
          security of your personal information, you can contact us at
          support@bizflip.io
        </p>
        <h3>7. Retention of personal information</h3>
        <p>
          bizflip will retain your information only for as long as is necessary
          for the purposes set out in this policy, for as long as your account
          is active (i.e., for the lifetime of your bizflip account), or as
          needed to provide the Services to you. If you no longer want Bizflip
          to use your information to provide the Services to you, you may close
          your account. Bizflip will retain and use your information to the
          extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations (for example, if
          we are required to retain your information to comply with applicable
          tax/revenue laws), resolve disputes, enforce our agreements, and as
          otherwise described in this policy. In addition, Bizflip sellers may
          also be required to retain and use your information in order to comply
          with their own legal obligations. <br></br>
          Please note that closing your account may not free up your email
          address for reuse on a new account. We also retain log files for
          internal analysis purposes. These log files are generally retained for
          a brief period of time, except in cases where they are used for site
          safety and security, to improve site functionality, or we are legally
          obligated to retain them for longer time periods.
        </p>
        <h3>8. Your rights </h3>
        <p>
          Certain privacy laws around the world provide users with rights
          related to their personal information.<br></br>
          Consistent with those laws, Bizflip gives you the choice of accessing,
          editing, or removing certain information, as well as choices about how
          we contact you. You may change or correct your bizflip account
          information through your account settings. You may also remove certain
          optional information that you no longer wish to be publicly visible
          through the Services, such as your name. You can also request to
          permanently close your account and delete your personal information.
          Depending on your location, you may also benefit from a number of
          rights with respect to your information. While some of these rights
          apply generally, certain rights apply in limited cases.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            You can access certain personal information associated with your
            account by visiting your account privacy settings. You can request a
            copy of your personal information in an easily accessible format and
            information explaining how that information is used.
          </li>
          <li>
            You have the right to request that we rectify inaccurate information
            about you. By visiting your account settings, you can correct and
            change certain personal information associated with your account.
          </li>
          <li>
            In certain cases where we process your information, you may also
            have the right to restrict or limit the ways in which we use your
            personal information.
          </li>
          <li>
            In certain circumstances, you have the right to request the deletion
            of your personal information, except information we are required to
            retain by law, regulation, or to protect the safety, security, and
            integrity of Bizflip.
          </li>
          <li>
            If we process your information based on our legitimate interests as
            explained above, or in the public interest, you can object to this
            processing in certain circumstances. In such cases, we will cease
            processing your information unless we have compelling legitimate
            grounds to continue processing or where it is needed for legal
            reasons. Where we use your personal data for direct marketing
            purposes, you can object using the unsubscribe link in such
            communications or changing your account email settings.
          </li>
          <li>
            Where we rely on consent, you can choose to withdraw your consent to
            our processing of your information using specific features provided
            to enable you to withdraw consent, like an email unsubscribe link or
            your account privacy preferences. If you have consented to share
            your precise device location details but would no longer like to
            continue sharing that information with us, you can revoke your
            consent to the sharing of that information through the settings on
            your mobile device. This is without prejudice to your right to
            generally permanently close your account and delete your personal
            information.
          </li>
          <li>
            US residents on instance may request disclosure of the specific
            pieces and/or categories of personal information that the business
            has collected about them, the categories of sources for that
            personal information, the business or commercial purposes for
            collecting the information, the categories of personal information
            that we have disclosed, and the categories of third parties with
            which the information was shared.
          </li>
          <li>
            To the extent that Bizflip “sells” personal information, US
            residents are entitled to opt-out of the “sale” of data at any time
            (see below for more information).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you would like to manage, change, limit, or delete your personal
          information, you can do so via your Bizflip account settings.
          Alternatively, you can exercise any of the rights above by contacting
          us by submitting a message via our help centre, chat support or email
          to support@bizflip.io. Once you contact us to exercise any of your
          rights, we will confirm receipt of your request.<br></br>
          Limiting use of, or deleting, your personal information may impact
          features and uses that rely on that information. However, we will not
          discriminate against you for exercising any of your rights, including
          otherwise denying you goods or services, providing you with a
          different level or quality of services, or charging you different
          prices or rates for services. If you need further assistance, you can
          contact Bizflip through one of the channels listed below under
          “Contact.” We will respond to your request within a reasonable
          timeframe. <br></br>
          Please note that we may verify your identity before we are able to
          process any of the requests described in this Section, and in our
          discretion, deny your request if we are unable to verify your
          identity. As a part of this process, government or other
          identification may be required. You may designate an authorised agent
          to make a request on your behalf. In order to designate an authorised
          agent to make a request on your behalf, you must provide a valid power
          of attorney, the requester’s valid government issued identification,
          and the authorised agent’s valid government issued identification, and
          we may verify the authenticity of the request directly with you. You
          may also control the receipt of certain types of communications from
          Bizflip in your account settings. Bizflip may send you messages about
          the Services or your activity. Some of these messages are required,
          service-related messages for users (such as transactional messages or
          legal notices). Other messages are not required, such as newsletters.
          You can control which optional messages you choose to receive by
          changing your account settings. If you no longer wish to use the
          Services or receive service-related messages (except for legally
          required notices), then you may close your account.<br></br>
          We use both technically necessary (for the functioning and security of
          the Services) and non-technically necessary cookies and similar
          technologies. A more detailed explanation of the technologies we use,
          and how to opt out when applicable.
          <b>Additional Disclosures for North Carolina Residents</b>
          In addition to the Rights & Choices described above, certain
          government organizations may request disclosure of the categories of
          personal information collected over the past 12 months. While this
          information is provided in greater detail in the sections above, the
          categories of personal information that we have collected are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Identifiers, including name, email address, shop name, IP address,
            and an ID or number assigned to your account.
          </li>
          <li>
            Other individual records such as phone number, billing address, or
            credit or debit card information. This category includes personal
            information protected under pre-existing California law (Cal. Civ.
            Code 1798.80(e)), and overlaps with other categories listed here.
          </li>
          <li>
            Commercial information, including purchases and engagement with the
            Services.
          </li>
          <li>
            Internet activity, including your interactions with our Services and
            what led you to our Services.
          </li>
          <li>Sensory visual data, such as pictures posted on our Website.</li>
          <li>
            Geolocation data provided through location enabled services such as
            WiFi and GPS.
          </li>
          <li>
            Inferences, including information about your interests, preferences
            and favourites.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We collect and use these categories of personal information for our
          business and commercial purposes described in the above sections,
          including providing and improving the Services, maintaining the safety
          and security of the Services, processing purchase and sale
          transactions, and for advertising and marketing services. Bizflip does
          not sell personal information to third parties for monetary value.
          However, the term “sale” is defined broadly under the N. Carolina
          Consumer Privacy Act. To the extent that “sale” under the NCPA is
          interpreted to include interest based advertising or other data uses
          described in the sections above, we will comply with applicable law as
          to those activities. <br></br>
          To opt-out of receiving interest-based advertising, you can exercise
          your choice by using your account privacy settings, or the general
          privacy settings link located at the footer of our homepage and most
          pages of the Website. The right to opt-out of interest-based
          advertising is available to all Bizflip users.<br></br>
          Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do
          Not Track” signal to online services you visit. Note, however, there
          is no industry consensus as to what site and app operators should do
          with regard to these signals. Accordingly, unless and until the law is
          interpreted to require us to do so, we do not monitor or North
          Carolina law entitles residents to ask for a notice describing what
          categories of personal information we share with third parties for
          their own direct marketing purposes. Other than to Sellers on Bizflip
          (see “Buying and Selling” under the “Information Uses, Sharing and
          Disclosure” Section above), who must obtain your separate consent for
          their own marketing off of Bizflip, or unless you request us to or
          consent to it, Bizflip does not share any personal information to
          third parties for their own direct marketing purposes. If you have
          questions about these practices, you can contact us through one of the
          channels listed in the “Contact” Section below. For information on
          interest-based advertising with Bizflip and how your information is
          used for marketing, see our Cookies & Tracking Policies. <br></br>
          If you have a disability and would like to access this policy in an
          alternative format, please contact us using one of the channels listed

        <h3>9. Your responsibilities</h3>
        <p>
          If you sell using our Services, you may receive and determine what to
          do with certain personal information. Your privacy responsibilities,
          including when you act as an independent data controller (someone who
          decides what personal data to collect and the purpose you use the data
          for) are laid out in our Terms of Service.
        </p>
        <h3>10. Policy Changes</h3>
        <p>
          We may amend or update this policy from time to time. If we believe
          that the changes are material, we’ll let you know by doing one (or
          more) of the following: (i) posting the changes on or through the
