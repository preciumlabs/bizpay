              non-monetary obligation upon Claimant or (b) Obligor does not
              agree to pay in full. The Obligor shall not be liable for any

              consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
              conditioned. Whether or not the Obligor elects to so defend or
              prosecute such claim, all the parties hereto shall cooperate in
              the defense or prosecution thereof and shall furnish such records,

              proceedings, hearings, trials, and appeals, as may be reasonably
